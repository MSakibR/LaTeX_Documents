This project introduces a farming system powered by green energy
cultural setup combining dual-axis sun tracking through
auto watering cuts power use while saving water
handling stuff with an ESP32 chip at its core,
sensor unit using four light detectors to track sun movement
detection yet two servo motors to keep tweaking the
solar panels need to face the right way to make most electricity. Yet, ground type matters too
moisture is tracked with a capacitive sensor, since it gives quick feedback when conditions shift - especially useful during sudden humidity changes
Letting the system water plants on its own using a switch that runs on low-power current
pump. Extra sensors - like a rain detector, DHT11
temp and humidity unit, then an ultrasonic sensor for water height
with the MQ-2 gas sensor - boosts tracking of air conditions
a solar panel powers a 7.4V bat
tury - keeping power steady without the grid. Also links up with smart devices online
using ESP32 lets you check data live from afar on a nearby network
server or a Telegram Bot sending alerts. Test outcomes
demonstrate around a quarter to nearly one third more electricity from sunlight using improved tech - boosted performance seen across tests
Unlike static panels, while also improving how water’s used
less waste. This setup offers an affordable,
sustainable yet practical fix that works well on small farms,
growing plants on rooftops, while also working in countryside farming areas.
